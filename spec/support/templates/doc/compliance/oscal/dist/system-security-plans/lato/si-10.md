# si-10 - \[\] Information Input Validation

## Control Statement

Check the validity of the following information inputs: character set, length, numerical range, and acceptable values; verifies that inputs match specified definitions for format and content as it relates to: (1) Username and password combinations. (2) Attributes used to validate a password reset request (e.g., security questions). (3) Personally identifiable information (excluding unique user name identifiers provided as a normal part of a transactional record). (4) Biometric data or personal characteristics used to authenticate identity. (5) Sensitive financial records (e.g., account numbers, access codes). (6) Content related to internal security functions: private encryption keys, whitelist or blacklist rules, object permission attributes and settings.

## Control guidance

Checking the valid syntax and semantics of system inputs—including character set, length, numerical range, and acceptable values—verifies that inputs match specified definitions for format and content. For example, if the organization specifies that numerical values between 1-100 are the only acceptable inputs for a field in a given application, inputs of "387," "abc," or "%K%" are invalid inputs and are not accepted as input to the system. Valid inputs are likely to vary from field to field within a software application. Applications typically follow well-defined protocols that use structured messages (i.e., commands or queries) to communicate between software modules or system components. Structured messages can contain raw or unstructured data interspersed with metadata or control information. If software applications use attacker-supplied inputs to construct structured messages without properly encoding such messages, then the attacker could insert malicious commands or special characters that can cause the data to be interpreted as control information or metadata. Consequently, the module or component that receives the corrupted output will perform the wrong operations or otherwise interpret the data incorrectly. Prescreening inputs prior to passing them to interpreters prevents the content from being unintentionally interpreted as commands. Input validation ensures accurate and correct inputs and prevents attacks such as cross-site scripting and a variety of injection attacks.
