18F Rails Template
============================
The 18F Rails template starts or upgrades Rails projects so that they're more secure, follow compliance rules, and are nearly ready to deploy onto cloud.gov. This gem sets up security checks and compliance diagrams, adds the U.S. Web Design System (USWDS), and much much more â€” [see the full list of features](#features).

This template will create a new Rails 8.0.x project.

[See the `rails-7.2` branch for Rails 7.2.x](https://github.com/gsa-tts/rails-template/tree/rails-7.2)

## Usage

### For a new Rails project

#### Install the gem:
```
$ gem install rails_template_18f
```

#### Decide whether to install Rails with Hotwire

[Hotwire](hotwire) is a framework for client-side interactivity using JavaScript that stops short of a full Single Page Application (SPA) framework like React or Vue.

It is a good choice if you need [a bit of client-side interactivity][aBitOfJS]. Do not use Hotwire if you either will have almost no Javascript at all, or if you are going to use a full SPA.

#### Review the defaults and decide if you want to override any of them

<details><summary>Default configuration</summary>

```sh
--skip-active-storage   # Don't include ActiveStorage for document upload
--skip-action-text      # Don't include ActionText libraries for WYSIWYG editing
--skip-action-cable     # Don't include ActionCable websocket implementation
--skip-action-mailbox   # Don't include inbound email
--skip-hotwire          # Don't include Hotwire JS library
--skip-docker           # Don't include Dockerfile meant for production use
--skip-test             # Skip built-in test framework. (We include RSpec)
--javascript=webpack    # Use webpack for JS bundling
--css=postcss           # Use the PostCSS framework for bundling CSS
--template=template.rb  # Add additional configuration from template.rb
--database=postgresql   # Use a PostgreSQL database
--skip-rubocop          # Skip rubocop integration in favor of Standard Ruby
--skip-ci               # Skip github actions in favor of our CI generators
--skip-kamal            # Skip kamal deployment system
--skip-thruster         # Skip thruster reverse proxy
--skip-solid            # Skip solid cache,queue,websocket additions
```

If you are using Hotwire, then `--skip-hotwire` and `--skip-action-cable` are automatically removed from this list, as they are required for the Hotwire functionality.

<br />

Add the following options at the end of your `rails_template_18f new` command to overwrite any of those defaults.

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `--no-skip-<framework>` | Each of the skipped frameworks listed above (also in `railsrc`) can be overridden on the command line. For example: `--no-skip-active-storage` will include support for `ActiveStorage` document uploads |
| `--javascript=esbuild` | Use [esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io/) instead of [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) for JavaScript bundling. Note that maintaining IE11 support with esbuild may be tricky. |

_TODO: Documentation on whether you can override the `css` and `database` options._

**Important:** Do not use flags `--skip-bundle` or `--skip-javascript`, or various parts of this template will break.

#### Create your application

<details><summary>If you are using Hotwire, run:</summary>

```
$ rails_template_18f new <project name> --hotwire ADDITIONAL_CONFIG_OPTIONS
```
</details>

<details><summary>If you are not using Hotwire, run:</summary>

```
$ rails_template_18f new <project name> ADDITIONAL_CONFIG_OPTIONS
```
</details>

#### Answer the setup questions that the template asks

The template asks questions to ensure your new application is set up for your use case.

<details><summary>Set up docker-trestle integration for Compliance-as-Code?</summary>

Answer `y` to integrate with [docker-trestle](https://github.com/gsa-tts/docker-trestle) for creating compliance documents in markdown and [OSCAL](https://pages.nist.gov/OSCAL/).

Follow up questions if you answer `y`:
* "Set up compliance documents as a git submodule?" Answer `y` if you want compliance documents to be stored in a separate git repository and linked to your app as a submodule. Answer `n` to have documents checked directly into your code repo.
  * If you answer `y`, you'll need to provide the address of the compliance repository.
* "Run compliance checks with auditree?" Answer `y` if you want to integrate with [auditree](https://github.com/gsa-tts/auditree-devtools) for automated compliance checks.
</details>

<details><summary>Create terraform files for cloud.gov services?</summary>

Answer `y` to run the `terraform` generator. This includes a `/terraform` folder defining services and infrastructure within cloud.gov as well as support for deploying that infrastructure in your chosen CI/CD pipeline.
</details>

<details><summary>Cloud.gov organization and space names</summary>

Provide your cloud.gov organization and space names for use in terraform and deploy scripts.
</details>

<details><summary>Create GitHub Actions?</summary>

Answer `y` to create Github Actions workflows for running tests, scans, and deploys. Also configures Dependabot.
</details>

<details><summary>Create CircleCI config?</summary>

Answer `y` to create a CircleCI workflow for running tests, scans, and deploys.
</details>

<details><summary>Create FEDRAMP New Relic config files?</summary>

Answer `y` to create a default New Relic config that can speak to the Government-flavored New Relic instance, including updating Content Security Policy headers so that browser metrics can be collected.
</details>

<details><summary>If this will be a public site, should we include Digital Analytics Program code?</summary>

Answer `y` to set up an integration with DAP.
</details>

<details><summary>Supported locales</summary>

Answer `y` for any languages that should be supported out of the box. Translations are supplied for the usa-banner. You will still be responsible for translating any application content.
</details>

<details><summary>Run db setup steps?</summary>

Answer `y` to run `rake db:create && rake db:migrate` as part of the app setup. PostgreSQL must be running or this will fail.
</details>
